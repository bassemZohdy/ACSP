# Abstract Customizable Customer Support Portal (ACSP)

## **Overview**
The Abstract Customizable Customer Support Portal (ACSP) is a multi-tenant, scalable, and customizable solution for managing customer support services. The portal is designed to be enterprise-grade, cloud-agnostic, and configurable for diverse industries. It supports integration with external ticketing systems and provides the flexibility to manage tickets internally if required. The system also supports autoscaling, branding, role-based access control, and robust notification services.

## **Core Features**

### **1. Multi-Tenancy**
- **Tenant Isolation**:
  - Data and configurations are isolated per tenant.
  - Support for schema-based multi-tenancy in PostgreSQL or separate databases per tenant.

- **Tenant-Specific Customizations**:
  - Branding: Configurable logos, themes, and colors.
  - Subdomains: E.g., `support.companyA.com` for Company A.

### **2. Flexible Ticketing**
- **External Integration**:
  - Adapter-based integration with ticketing systems like Jira, Zendesk, or ServiceNow.
  - Configurable API parameters for external systems (endpoints, authentication).

- **Internal Ticketing**:
  - Full lifecycle management (creation, update, SLA tracking).
  - Optional integration with a workflow engine (e.g., Camunda) to support custom workflows.

### **3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Roles**:
  - Admin: Manage tenants, users, configurations, and reporting.
  - Agent: Resolve tickets, respond to customers, and manage knowledge bases.
  - Customer: Raise tickets, view statuses, and interact with support agents.

### **4. Notification Service**
- **Channels**:
  - Email, SMS, and push notifications.
  - Webhooks for tenant-specific notification systems.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Ticket creation, updates, SLA breaches.
  - Workflow status changes.

### **5. Observability**
- **Monitoring**:
  - Integrated with OpenTelemetry for tracing and metrics.
  - Centralized dashboards with Prometheus and Grafana.

- **Logging**:
  - Centralized log aggregation with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

### **6. Autoscaling**
- **Levels of Scaling**:
  - Microservice-Level: Individual services scale based on load (e.g., ticketing, notifications).
  - Tenant-Level: Resource allocation scales for tenants experiencing high traffic.

- **Implementation**:
  - Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
  - Metrics-driven scaling using Prometheus.
